The Teleport Command
====================

The Teleport command is an improved version of the Unix/Linux `cd` command. The teleport command (tp, for short) does everything the Linux cd command does, with these improvements:

* It keeps a history, remembering the directories you've visited before.
* It can display your history.
* You can easily jump to any directory in your history.
* And you can create aliases for your directories to make it even easier to jump to them.
